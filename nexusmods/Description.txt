[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Manual Installation[/b][/size][/font]
[size=2]As for now Vortex doesn't support the game, so you have to install the mod manually.[/size]
1. Download the latest version of RE-UE4SS from it's [url=https://github.com/UE4SS-RE/RE-UE4SS/releases]Release[/url] section. You need the [b]UE4SS_v{version nummber}.zip[/b] (e.g. UE4SS_v3.0.1.zip)
2. Unzip the content of the zip archive into the following location: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i]
[size=2]It should be at the location of the [b]AbioticFactor-Win64-Shipping.exe[/b] !
For Steam users it might be something like this: [i]C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\[/i][/size]
3. Now use the [b]Manual Download[/b] button in [i]Files[/i] tab to download the mod as a zip file as well.
4. Unzip/extract the content of mod's zip ([b]InstantFishing[/b] folder) into the directory: [i](game root directory)\AbioticFactor\Binaries\Win64\Mods\[/i]

[font=Verdana][size=4][b]Known Issues[/b][/size][/font]
Current UE4SS version works well with the game, but it has of a problem that causes the game to crash when you exit it.
It has nothing to do with the mod and it has no negative impact on the game or your save file, it's just a bit annoying.
And you might want to delete crash dump ([b].dmp[/b]) files from time to time from your game directory.
